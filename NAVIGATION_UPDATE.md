# Navigation System Update

## Overview
Implemented a custom navigation system where Dashboard is the default/home page and all back navigation leads to Dashboard.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Custom Back Navigation
- **Dashboard**: Back button shows exit confirmation dialog
- **All Other Pages**: Back button navigates to Dashboard
- **Hardware Back Button**: Works on Android devices
- **UI Back Button**: Shows on all non-dashboard pages

### 2. Exit Confirmation
- Shows native Alert dialog with "Exit" and "Cancel" options
- Only appears when user tries to go back from Dashboard
- Properly exits the app when confirmed

### 3. Automatic Back Button Display
- Back button automatically appears on all pages except Dashboard
- No manual configuration needed per page
- Consistent UI across the entire app

## Files Modified

### Core Navigation
- `hooks/useCustomNavigation.ts` - Custom navigation hook
- `components/SharedLayout.tsx` - Integrated custom navigation
- `components/TopNavBar.tsx` - Updated back button logic
- `app/dashboard.tsx` - Added navigation hook

### Navigation Flow
```

```

## Usage
All pages using `SharedLayout` automatically get the new navigation behavior. No additional setup required.
