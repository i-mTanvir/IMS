# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current SupportPage.tsx component has several issues that prevent it from working properly in the React Native/Expo environment. The component is importing from `lucide-react` (web React) instead of `lucide-react-native`, using web-specific styling approaches, and referencing non-existent UI components and type definitions. This feature will fix these issues and create a properly functioning support page that integrates with the existing app structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the support page to work without import errors, so that the application can compile and run successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the support page is imported THEN the system SHALL use `lucide-react-native` instead of `lucide-react`
2. WHEN the component is rendered THEN the system SHALL not throw any module resolution errors
3. WHEN the app is built THEN the system SHALL successfully compile without missing dependency errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the support page to use React Native components and styling, so that it renders correctly on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the support page is rendered THEN the system SHALL use React Native components (View, Text, ScrollView, etc.) instead of HTML elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the support page to integrate with existing app components and contexts, so that it maintains consistency with the rest of the application.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access comprehensive help documentation, so that I can learn how to use the inventory management system effectively.
