# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the complete database integration for the Serrano Tex Inventory Management System using Supabase as the backend. The system requires a comprehensive PostgreSQL database with 19+ core tables, role-based security, real-time updates, and seamless integration with the existing React Native application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Schema Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a complete PostgreSQL database schema implemented in Supabase, so that all business operations can be properly stored and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is created THEN all 19 core tables SHALL be implemented with proper relationships
2. WHEN tables are created THEN all ENUMs SHALL be defined for data consistency
3. WHEN foreign keys are established THEN referential integrity SHALL be maintained
4. WHEN constraints are applied THEN data validation SHALL be enforced at database level
5. WHEN indexes are created THEN query performance SHALL be optimized

### Requirement 2: Role-Based Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented, so that users can only access data appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN RLS is enabled THEN Super Admin SHALL have full access to all data
2. WHEN Admin users access data THEN they SHALL see data based on their permissions
3. WHEN Sales Manager accesses data THEN they SHALL only see their assigned location data
4. WHEN Investor accesses data THEN they SHALL have read-only access to dashboard data
5. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access

### Requirement 3: Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Supabase Auth integrated with the existing authentication system, so that users can securely log in and maintain sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user logs in THEN Supabase Auth SHALL authenticate the user
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN user role and permissions SHALL be retrieved
3. WHEN session is established THEN RLS policies SHALL be applied automatically
4. WHEN user logs out THEN session SHALL be properly terminated
5. WHEN token expires THEN user SHALL be prompted to re-authenticate

### Requirement 4: Real-time Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time updates across all devices, so that inventory and sales data is always current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventory changes THEN all connected clients SHALL receive updates immediately
2. WHEN sales are recorded THEN stock levels SHALL update in real-time
3. WHEN transfers are approved THEN stock movements SHALL be reflected instantly
4. WHEN payments are recorded THEN due amounts SHALL update automatically
5. WHEN notifications are created THEN users SHALL receive them immediately

### Requirement 5: Data Migration and Seeding

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want initial data and sample records created, so that the system can be tested and demonstrated effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database is initialized THEN default categories SHALL be created
2. WHEN setup is complete THEN sample locations SHALL be available
3. WHEN system starts THEN default user roles SHALL be configured
4. WHEN demo data is needed THEN sample products and customers SHALL be available
5. WHEN testing begins THEN realistic data relationships SHALL exist

### Requirement 6: API Integration Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive API service layer, so that the React Native app can efficiently communicate with Supabase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN proper error handling SHALL be implemented
2. WHEN data is fetched THEN loading states SHALL be managed appropriately
3. WHEN mutations occur THEN optimistic updates SHALL be supported
4. WHEN offline mode is needed THEN local caching SHALL be available
5. WHEN sync is required THEN conflict resolution SHALL be handled

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast query performance and efficient data loading, so that the application responds quickly to all interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complex queries run THEN response time SHALL be under 500ms
2. WHEN large datasets are loaded THEN pagination SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN searches are performed THEN full-text search SHALL be optimized
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN database views SHALL improve performance
5. WHEN concurrent users access data THEN system SHALL maintain responsiveness

### Requirement 8: Backup and Recovery

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated backups and recovery procedures, so that business data is protected and recoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backups are scheduled THEN they SHALL run automatically daily
2. WHEN data loss occurs THEN point-in-time recovery SHALL be available
3. WHEN corruption is detected THEN integrity checks SHALL identify issues
4. WHEN recovery is needed THEN data SHALL be restored with minimal downtime
5. WHEN backup verification runs THEN integrity SHALL be confirmed

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics, so that system health and usage patterns can be tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system runs THEN performance metrics SHALL be collected
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged and tracked
3. WHEN usage patterns emerge THEN analytics SHALL provide insights
4. WHEN capacity limits approach THEN alerts SHALL be generated
5. WHEN optimization is needed THEN bottlenecks SHALL be identified

### Requirement 10: Development and Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper development and testing environments, so that changes can be safely developed and tested before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development occurs THEN separate environment SHALL be available
2. WHEN testing is performed THEN test data SHALL not affect production
3. WHEN migrations are created THEN they SHALL be version controlled
4. WHEN schema changes occur THEN they SHALL be applied consistently
5. WHEN deployment happens THEN zero-downtime updates SHALL be supported
