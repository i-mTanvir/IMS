# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for optimizing the mobile form popup experience in the SERRANO TEX mobile application. Currently, form popups (CategoryAddForm, CustomerAddForm, ProductAddForm, RoleAddForm, SupplierAddForm) are positioned at the bottom of the screen and slide up from the bottom, which creates a poor mobile user experience. The goal is to transform these forms to display from the top of the screen with better mobile-optimized layouts and interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want form popups to appear from the top of the screen, so that I have a more natural and accessible mobile experience when adding or editing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens any add/edit form THEN the system SHALL display the form sliding down from the top of the screen
2. WHEN the form appears THEN the system SHALL position it starting from the top with proper status bar spacing
3. WHEN the user interacts with the form THEN the system SHALL maintain the top-positioned layout throughout the interaction
4. WHEN the form closes THEN the system SHALL animate it sliding back up to the top of the screen
5. WHEN the form is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it covers the full screen height appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want form headers to be easily accessible and properly positioned, so that I can quickly understand what form I'm working with and access close/cancel actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form opens THEN the system SHALL display a fixed header at the top with clear title and close button
2. WHEN the user scrolls through form content THEN the system SHALL keep the header visible and accessible
3. WHEN the user taps the close button THEN the system SHALL provide immediate response and close the form
4. WHEN the form header is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper spacing from device status bar
5. WHEN the header contains actions THEN the system SHALL make them easily tappable with appropriate touch targets

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want form content to be properly scrollable and keyboard-friendly, so that I can efficiently fill out forms on my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form content exceeds screen height THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scrolling within the form area
2. WHEN the keyboard appears THEN the system SHALL adjust the form layout to keep active inputs visible
3. WHEN the user navigates between form fields THEN the system SHALL automatically scroll to keep the active field in view
4. WHEN the form has multiple sections THEN the system SHALL organize them in a mobile-friendly vertical layout
5. WHEN the user interacts with dropdowns or pickers THEN the system SHALL handle them appropriately for mobile screens

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want form action buttons to be easily accessible and properly positioned, so that I can save or cancel my changes without difficulty.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form is displayed THEN the system SHALL position action buttons (Save/Cancel) at the bottom in a fixed footer
2. WHEN the user scrolls through form content THEN the system SHALL keep action buttons visible and accessible
3. WHEN the user taps action buttons THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN the form has validation errors THEN the system SHALL prevent submission and show clear error indicators
5. WHEN the form is being submitted THEN the system SHALL show loading states and disable duplicate submissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want consistent form behavior across all add/edit forms, so that I have a predictable and familiar experience throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any form is opened THEN the system SHALL use consistent animation timing and easing
2. WHEN forms are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent header styling and positioning
3. WHEN form content is laid out THEN the system SHALL use consistent spacing, typography, and input styling
4. WHEN forms handle keyboard interactions THEN the system SHALL behave consistently across all forms
5. WHEN forms are closed THEN the system SHALL use consistent exit animations and cleanup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want forms to handle different screen sizes and orientations properly, so that I can use them effectively on various mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form is displayed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
2. WHEN the device orientation changes THEN the system SHALL maintain form usability and proper positioning
3. WHEN the form is displayed on tablets THEN the system SHALL optimize the layout for larger screens
4. WHEN the form handles safe areas THEN the system SHALL respect device-specific spacing requirements
5. WHEN the form content adapts THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and touch target sizes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want forms to provide proper feedback and error handling, so that I understand the status of my actions and can correct any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL highlight errors clearly with mobile-appropriate indicators
2. WHEN the form is loading or saving THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with retry options
4. WHEN the form submission succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback before closing
5. WHEN the user attempts to close an unsaved form THEN the system SHALL warn about unsaved changes
