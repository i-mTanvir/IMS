# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the existing plus button in the bottom navigation from opening a new page to displaying a radial menu overlay with 5 quick action options. The implementation includes a semi-transparent background overlay and smooth animations for an enhanced user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the plus button and see a radial menu with quick actions, so that I can quickly access common add functions without navigating to a separate page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the plus button THEN the system SHALL display a semi-transparent dark overlay covering the entire screen
2. WHEN the overlay appears THEN the system SHALL show 5 circular action buttons arranged in a radial pattern around the plus button
3. WHEN the radial menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL show smooth fade-in animations for both the overlay and menu items
4. WHEN the user clicks outside the menu area THEN the system SHALL close the radial menu with smooth fade-out animations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see 5 specific action options in the radial menu, so that I can quickly add different types of data to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the radial menu opens THEN the system SHALL display "Add Products" as the first option
2. WHEN the radial menu opens THEN the system SHALL display "Customer" as the second option  
3. WHEN the radial menu opens THEN the system SHALL display "Category" as the third option
4. WHEN the radial menu opens THEN the system SHALL display "Suppliers" as the fourth option
5. WHEN the radial menu opens THEN the system SHALL display "New Role" as the fifth option
6. WHEN any menu option is clicked THEN the system SHALL close the menu (logic to be implemented later)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth animations when interacting with the radial menu, so that the interface feels polished and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the plus button is pressed THEN the system SHALL animate the button with a smooth press effect
2. WHEN the radial menu appears THEN the system SHALL animate each menu item with a staggered fade-in effect
3. WHEN the menu closes THEN the system SHALL animate all elements with a smooth fade-out effect
4. WHEN menu items appear THEN the system SHALL use a radial arrangement similar to the reference image provided

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the radial menu to integrate seamlessly with the existing bottom navigation, so that the interface remains consistent and intuitive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the radial menu is open THEN the system SHALL keep the bottom navigation visible but overlaid
2. WHEN the overlay is active THEN the system SHALL prevent interaction with elements behind the overlay
3. WHEN the menu closes THEN the system SHALL restore normal navigation functionality
4. IF the user navigates away from the current screen THEN the system SHALL automatically close the radial menu
