### 4. UI Components Cleaned
- ✅ **app/products.tsx** - Mock data removed
  - Removed all mock product data (mockProducts array)
  - Set products state to empty array
  - Kept UI structure intact for future database integration

- ✅ **app/inventory.tsx** - Product-related functionality removed
  - Removed StockItem and StockTransfer interfaces
  - Removed all mock stock items and transfers
  - Removed product-related render functions
  - Kept only location-based inventory management
  - Added placeholder for future product integration

- ✅ **components/forms/ProductAddForm.tsx** - Mock data removed
  - Removed all mock categories, suppliers, and locations arrays
  - Set arrays to empty for future database population
  - Kept form structure intact

### 5. Documentation Updated
- ✅ **Complete Database Design Documentation.md**
  - Marked "Table 6: products" as REMOVED
  - Added note about clean implementation from scratch

- ✅ **.trae/rules/project_rules.md**
  - Commented out Products table schema
  - Marked Product_Lots table as REMOVED
  - Added notes about future implementation

## What Remains Intact:

### UI Components (Ready for Database Integration)
- ✅ **app/products.tsx** - Complete UI structure
- ✅ **components/forms/ProductAddForm.tsx** - Complete form with all fields
- ✅ **app/inventory.tsx** - Location management still functional

### Database Infrastructure
- ✅ All other working database services (users, categories, suppliers, customers)
- ✅ Base database service classes
- ✅ Supabase connection and configuration
- ✅ Authentication and permissions system (minus product permissions)

## Next Steps for Product Implementation:

1. **Design New Product Schema**
   - Create clean product table design
   - Define proper relationships with categories, suppliers, locations
   - Plan inventory tracking approach

2. **Create Database Services**
   - Implement ProductService class
   - Add proper CRUD operations
   - Integrate with existing base service

3. **Restore Type Definitions**
   - Create proper Product interfaces
   - Add back product permissions to user system
   - Update report types to include products

4. **Connect UI to Database**
   - Replace empty arrays with database calls
   - Implement real product CRUD operations
   - Add proper error handling and loading states

## Benefits of This Cleanup:

- ✅ **Clean Slate**: No conflicting or outdated product code
- ✅ **Preserved UI**: All product forms and pages remain functional
- ✅ **Maintained Structure**: Database architecture intact
- ✅ **Clear Path Forward**: Easy to implement products from scratch
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Other modules (categories, suppliers, customers) unaffected

Your project is now ready for clean product implementation from the ground up!
